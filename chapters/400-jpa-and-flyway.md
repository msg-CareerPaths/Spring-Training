### 4. JPA and Flyway

Goal: Initialize the database schema and map the tables to Java classes using JPA.

Online Shop:

> Running the application at this point, will result in an error due to missing postgreSQL database connection.
> 
> Setup in pgAdmin an `online-shop server` > then a `online-shop database` > and then a `online-shop schema`.
> 
> The `application.properties` file, inside the created Spring Boot application, should contain the database connection details. The `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` should be set to `validate` as we are using Flyway.
>
> After the database connection details were set correctly, the application should start.
>
> Create a data model for your application in a Flyway SQL migration. You should use as a guideline the database diagram provided.
>
> PostgreSQL has support to UUID, so you can use it instead of commonly used auto-increment integer. UUID is helpful to avoid a normal attack in which the hacker tries to increase or decrease an entity ID to discover new information. 
> 
> Translate this data model into Java entity classes. Use Lombok to annotate these classes with `@Data` annotations to generate getters, setters, equals and hashCode. Hint: *it might be useful to create a base entity class (containing just the primary key) or an interface (containing the primary key getter and setter) to be able to handle entities generically if needed.*
>
> Annotate all the entities with the proper JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@OneToMany`, etc). Write Spring Data JPA repositories to allow easy access to your entities.

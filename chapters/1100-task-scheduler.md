Online Shop:

> The owner of the Online Shop wants to see a sales report every morning for the day before. To cater for this requirement, create a periodical job that runs at the end of each day. It should aggregate all the sales revenues for each location for that day and store the result into the *Revenue* database table.
>
> Create a `@RestController` with a `GET` mapping for exporting the revenue data for a given date.

> Implement a new greedy strategy that selects locations based on the proximity to the delivery address:
>
> - Find the location which is the closest to the order's delivery address.
> - Take all the available needed products from that location.
> - Until we have all the products we need, repeat the above steps (by going to the second closest location, then to the third and so on).
>
> To compute the distances, use the [MapQuest route matrix API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/directions-api/route-matrix/post/). You will first need to [register on the MapQuest site](https://developer.mapquest.com/plan_purchase/steps/business_edition/business_edition_free/register) and obtain an API Key.

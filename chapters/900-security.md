> Implement a custom `UserDetailsService` which retrieves usernames and passwords from your database.
>
> Build two Spring configurations for securing your application: one with HTTP Basic and one with Form based login. These configurations should be active based on a Spring profile (e.g. `with-basic` and `with-form`) or based on a property such that only one of them is active at a time.
>
> Adjust your Postman Tests to also handle authentication.

> Register an account on GitHub with the msg email and create a new GitHub repository for Spring Training. Clone this repository locally and create a develop branch from the master branch before starting to work. During the course of the training, you will commit and push your work on this branch.
>
> Go to "Spring Initializr" and generate a new project:
> - Group: `ro.msg.learning`,
> - Artifact: `shop`,
> - Dependencies: `Web`, `JPA`, `Flyway`, `PostgreSQL Driver`, `Lombok`.
>
> Extract the generated `zip` file into the previously cloned repository. Import this project into your IDE. You can delete the `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd` and `.mvn` files / folders as you have Maven in the IDE anyway.
>
> Install [pgAdmin](https://www.sqlshack.com/an-overview-of-pgadmin-postgresql-management-tool/) on your computer which will provide you a way to query and manage your database.
